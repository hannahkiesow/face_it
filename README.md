🚀 Project Kickoff – Face It
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧪 Experiments with Random Images for Face Emotion Recognition Dataset

✅ Baseline Model (custom architecture) → Accuracy: 35–45%

✅ Dipali’s Model → Accuracy: 45%

✅ MobileNetV2 → Accuracy: 40%

✅ EfficientNetB0 → Accuracy: 47%


Plan: Build a baseline model + 4 pre-trained models (transfer learning)

🔍 EDA & Dataset Challenges
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We did EDA and attempted training, but accuracy was not improving 😕

Raised a ticket with TA 🧑‍🏫 → Suggested to try another dataset

Decided to switch to the FER 2013 Dataset

👉 FER 2013 Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/code/ray27th/facial-emotion-recognition-67-4/input

✅ Build a model or use pretrained model

🔧 Tuning architecture

🌀 Advanced data augmentation

💪 Progress on FER-2013 Dataset
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dataset Size: 35K images (CSV format)

✅ Dipali’s Model → Achieved 64% accuracy with Data Augmentation

✅ Hanns's Model → with pretrained EfficientNet with accuracy ... 

✅Simon's Model → with pretrained ResNet50 with accuracy 67%

🤖 Testing more pre-trained models

⚡ Next Goal: Create FastAPI , Docker Image

✅Simon's Model → with pretrained ResNet50 with accuracy 68%

✅ Hannah created FastAPI, Docker Image

✅ Rafa's Model with pretrained model and achieved accuracy of ----%

🤖 Testing more pre-trained models

⚡ Next Goal: Tweak with models to achieve good accuracy, Streamlit

📅 05 September 2025
💪 Progress on FER-2013 Dataset
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everybody continued improving their own models.

✅ Dipali’s Model → Achieved 67% accuracy with Data Augmentation. Tried more but accuracy is not improving. 

✅ Simon's Model → with pretrained ResNet50 with accuracy 69%

✅ Hannah's Model with pretrained FaceNet achieved accuracy of 62%

✅ Hannah's Model with pretrained FaceNet achieved accuracy of 62% 

Team set the target for Monday (08 Sept): train their own final models using a new balanced dataset.

💪 Progress on FER-2013 Dataset
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TA's gave us suggestion not to go with multiple models so, we decided to finalize Simon's model with more accuracy of 69% 

✅ Simon's Model → last try for transfer learning 

✅ Dipali’s Model → last try for transfer learning 

✅ Rafa's Model → last try for transfer learning 

✅ Anna's Model → last try for transfer learning and she achieved 50% accuracy with her Model

✅ Hannah working with Streamlit template

TA's gave us suggestion not to go with multiple models so, we decided to finalize Simon's model with more accuracy of 69% 

✅ Simon's Model → with pretrained ResNet50 with accuracy 69% converted to .py and Submitted to Hannah

✅ Dipali’s Model → Achieved 67% accuracy and converted it to .py and submitted to Hannah (Its just for Plan B)

✅ Hannah working with Fast API, Docker Image and Streamlit.

✅ Rafa and Anna Working on Presentation slides.
