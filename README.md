# face_it
Le Wagon final project titled Face It. In this project, we will classify emotions on human faces.

Using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudarshanvaidya/random-images-for-face-emotion-recognition,

We trained a baseline model where we built the model architecture ourselves. Accuracy was always between 35-45%

We then used different pre-trained models, fine-tuned them and also added data augmentation: 
MobileNetV2 - accuracy 40%
EfficientNetB0 - accuracy 47%

Next steps, we are going to use another kaggle dataset, the 
Facial-Emotion-Recognition (https://www.kaggle.com/code/ray27th/facial-emotion-recognition-67-4/input) 

We will create a baseline model, plus try out 4 different pre-trained models for transfer learning
